# Run Development Environment And Build Application (MANUALLY)

## Prerequisites

1. Install Docker Compose and Git locally.
2. Append the dev domain name `127.0.0.1   starter.test` in `/etc/hosts`:

    ```shell
    sudo vim /etc/hosts
    ```

### Build Development Environment

1. Create environment variable files in the **dev_env** and **app/api** folders (use sample files as reference):

    ```shell
    cp .env.build .env
    ```

2. Make sure to configure the ports in the `.env` file if the local system uses the defaults:

    ```shell
    vim .env
    ```

3. Create empty folders in the **dev_env** folder by running:

    ```shell
    mkdir data
    mkdir logs        
    ```

4. In folder **dev_env** run:

    ```shell
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5. Build the application using the respective Docker containers:
    - **For the Laravel API**, start the app container by running:

        ```shell
        docker exec -it app /bin/bash
        ```

        Then, in the folder within the app container **app/api**, run the following commands:

        ```shell
        composer install && php artisan config:clear && php artisan view:clear && php artisan route:clear && composer dump-autoload && php artisan cache:clear && php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache
        ```

        Run these commands to migrate and populate the database:

        ```shell
        php artisan migrate:fresh && php artisan db:seed
        ```

    - **For the Vuejs Admin Panel SPA**, start the app container by running:

        ```shell
        docker exec -it node /bin/bash
        ```

        Then, in the folder within the node container **app/client**, run the following commands:

        ```shell
        npm install && npm run dev
        ```

### Tips

If there is some issue with the Docker configuration at this point and you have previously run an older configuration, please try clearing the cache from the broken docker-compose version:

```shell
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker system prune -a
```

To fix Permission issues for Laravel in folder **app/api** outside of docker containers run:
OPTION 1
```shell
sudo chown -R www-data. . && sudo setfacl -R -m u:$USER:rwx .
```
OPTION 2
```shell
sudo chown -R $USER:www-data .
```
Then give both yourself and the webserver permissions:
```shell
sudo find . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;   
sudo find . -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \;
```

## Useful commands:

Get a list of all running or failed containers
```shell
docker ps -a
```
To execute commands inside a container
```shell
docker exec -it app /bin/bash
```
Run a container for a service defined in the docker-compose.yaml file. You will have to execute this command from the **dev_env** folder
```shell
docker-compose exec -it app node /bin/bash
```
Clear all docker cache containers networks etc ... This will remove docker containers for other projects too not just starter
```shell
docker system prune -a
```
