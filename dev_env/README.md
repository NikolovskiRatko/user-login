##  Run Development Environment

###  Prerequisites

1. Install Docker Compose and Git locally

###  Build Development Environment

1. Create environment variable files in the **dev_env** and **app/api** folders (use sample files as reference)
```shell
cp .env.sample .env
```

2. Make sure to configure the ports in the .env file if the local system uses the defaults
```shell
vim .env
```

3. In folder **dev_env** run:
```shell
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Build the application using the respective Docker containers
    For the Laravel API start the app container by running:
    ```shell
    docker exec -it app /bin/bash
    ```
    Then in folder within the app container **app/api** run the following commands:
    ```shell
    composer install && php artisan config:clear && php artisan view:clear && php artisan route:clear && composer dump-autoload && php artisan cache:clear && php artisan config:cache && php artisan route:cache
    ```
    Run these commands to migrate and populate the database:
    ```shell
    php artisan migrate:fresh && php artisan db:seed
    ```

    For the Vuejs Admin Panel SPA start the app container by running:
    ```shell
    docker exec -it node /bin/bash
    ```
    Then in folder within the node container **app/client** run the following commands:
    ```shell
    npm install && npm run dev
    ```

### Tips

If there is some issue with the docker configuration at this point and you have previously run an older configuration please try clearing the cache from the broken docker-compose version
```shell
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
docker system prune -a
```

To fix Permission issues for Laravel folder in folder **app/api** outside of docker containers:
```shell
sudo chown -R www-data. . && sudo setfacl -R -m u:$USER:rwx .
```

## Useful commands:

Get a list of all running or failed containers
```shell
docker ps -a
```
To execute commands inside a container
```shell
docker exec -it app /bin/bash
```
Run a container for a service defined in the docker-compose.yaml file. You will have to execute this command from the **dev_env** folder
```shell
docker-compose exec -it app node /bin/bash
```
Clear all docker cache containers networks etc ... This will remove docker containers for other projects too not just starter
```shell
docker system prune -a
```
